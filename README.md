# React-Challenge

## Purpose

This exercise is for you to demonstrate your ability to create a performant web application that matches a design mockup and feature specs in features and functionality.

## What we're looking for

* Proficiency in code architecture and implementation in creating a performant application to spec.
* Ability to use HTML / CSS / JS to match a design mockup.
* Ability to write clean, well-organized, and easily understandable code.
* Consideration for edge cases, errors, loading / empty states, etc.

## Challenge

Create a React app that communicates with our mock RESTful JSON API, allowing the user to login and view messages in a basic email client interface. It should meet the following requirements:

* User should be able to "login" with an email / password combination
* Upon successful login, display a list of threads retrieved from the api in the left-hand column.
* When a Thread is selected, it's corresponding messages should be displayed in the right-hand pane along with each of its messages.
* User should be able to "reply" to a thread by composing a message in the bottom-right text area. A reply that is "sent" should appear as a message in the corresponding thread.

### Resources

## Bonus Points

These are not required, but would be great additions if time permits:

* Full test coverage
* Have search input filter threads
* Offline cache / support
* Allow file attachments to be included in a "reply"
* Suggested Technologies: Webpack, React, Redux, Redux-Observable, React-Router. *Feel free to use what you're familiar with, as you're not expected to know any/all of these technologies*
