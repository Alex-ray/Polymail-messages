# React-Challenge

### Purpose

This exercise is for you to demonstrate your ability to create a performant React application that matches a design mockup and feature specs in features and functionality.

### What we're looking for

* Proficiency in code architecture and implementation in creating a performant application to spec.
* Ability to use HTML / CSS / JS to match a design mockup.
* Ability to write clean, well-organized, and easily understandable code.
* Consideration for edge cases, errors, loading / empty states, etc.

### Challenge

Create a React app that communicates with our [mock REST API](https://github.com/polymail/phony), allowing the user to login and view messages in a basic email client interface. It should meet the following requirements:

* User should be able to "login" with either email / password combination provided by the [mock API specs](https://github.com/polymail/phony).
* Upon successful login, display a list of threads retrieved from the [mock API](https://github.com/polymail/phony) in the left-hand column.
* When a Thread is selected, it should be displayed in the right-hand pane along with each of its messages.
* User should be able to "reply" to a thread by composing a message in the bottom-right text area. A reply that is "sent" should appear as a message in the corresponding thread.

### Bonus Points

These are not required, but would be great additions if time permits:

* Full test coverage
* Filter the threads from the search input
* Implement a method to persist all data retrieved from the server (or created by the user)
* Suggested Technologies (Webpack, React, Redux, React-Router)
